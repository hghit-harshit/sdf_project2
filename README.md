# The Programming Languages Zoo

The Programming Languages Zoo, or *PL Zoo* for short, is a collection of implementations
of miniature programming languages which demonstrates various techniques used in
implementation of programming languages. It is a good starting point for those who would
like to implement their own programming language, or just learn how it is done.

See the [PL Zoo website](http://plzoo.andrej.com/) for further information, including
installation instructions.
